# AWS Cloud Admin Foundations (Learning Lab)

This repository documents my hands-on learning and experimentation with AWS platform fundamentals and cloud administration practices.

## Scope
- Identity and access boundaries (IAM concepts)
- Network foundations (VPC, subnets, routing)
- Observability basics (logging/monitoring concepts)
- Infrastructure as Code workflow (Terraform, in progress)

## Notes
This is an evolving learning project and not a production environment. The focus is on transferable cloud administration principles: least privilege, secure defaults, repeatability, and operational clarity.
